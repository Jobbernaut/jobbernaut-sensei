# ðŸ¤– Jobbernaut Sensei

An AI-powered personal tutor to master technical interviews. Sensei tracks your progress, adapts to your skill level, and gets you ready for the real thing.

## The Problem

Technical interview prep is fragmented, stressful, and lonely. It's impossible to know if you're *really* improving or just memorizing solutions.

You grind LeetCode, read system design blogs, and watch mock interviews, but you never get to practice the most important skill: **thinking and communicating under pressure.** How do you track your "thought process"? How do you know what problem to tackle next?

## The Solution

**Sensei** is your personal AI interview tutor, designed to manage your entire preparation and actively improve your problem-solving logic.

It's a single platform that consolidates LeetCode, Low-Level Design (LLD), and High-Level Design (HLD) problems. On one side, you have your problem lists and progress. On the other, you have your Sensei, who operates in two distinct modes.

## Core Features

### ðŸ§  AI Training Mode
Your patient, personal guide. In this mode, the Sensei is gentle and Socratic.

* **Adaptive Learning:** Sensei maintains a memory of your capabilities, referring back to problems you've solved to find patterns in your thinking.
* **Guided Problem Solving:** It won't give you the answer. It asks guiding questions (e.g., "What data structure could help you look up items faster? What are the tradeoffs?") to help you build a durable thought process.
* **Holistic Tracking:** See exactly how far you've come and how much you have left to prepare, all in one place.

### ðŸ”¥ AI Interview Mode
Your high-pressure simulator. This mode is designed to mimic the stress of a real technical screen.

* **The "Griller":** The Sensei fires random problems at you from your chosen topics.
* **Stopwatch Pressure:** A visible timer ticks down, training you to manage your time and stay calm.
* **Blunt Feedback:** After the session, the Sensei gives you direct, actionable feedback on your solution, your communication, and your time management.

## Project Status

**ðŸŒ± Ideation & Proof of Concept Phase**

The core vision is defined. The next step is to build the initial proof of concept, focusing on the AI prompting and the core chat interface.
